# My Utilities 
 This project contains the common utilities that are used in nearly every project that I make. The list of which are as follows.

```buildoutcfg
1. CustomException: src/utilities/andy_exceptions.py
2. Logger: src/utilities/andy_logger.py
3. Singletons: src/utilities/andy_singleton.py
4. yaml_reader: src/utilities/constants.py
5. db_pool_executor: src/utilities/db.py
```

Note:- To use the yaml reader, define a YAML file under resources folder<br/>
Note:- To use the db_pool_executor initialize db details as defined in the constants.yaml file
